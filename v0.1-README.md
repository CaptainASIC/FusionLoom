# FusionLoom v0.1

This is the initial version (v0.1) of FusionLoom, focusing solely on the GUI component using the open-webui container. This version serves as the foundation for the comprehensive AI platform described in the main README.

## Overview

FusionLoom v0.1 provides a simple web-based user interface using the open-webui container. This initial version is designed to work with both Docker and Podman container engines, making it accessible to a wide range of users regardless of their preferred container technology.

```

## Requirements

- Linux-based operating system (Debian, RHEL, Fedora, or Arch-based)
- Docker or Podman (will be installed by setup script if not present)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CaptainASIC/FusionLoom
   ```

2. Navigate to the FusionLoom directory:
   ```bash
   cd FusionLoom
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   The setup script will:
   - Detect your OS and install necessary dependencies
   - Check for Docker or Podman and install Podman if neither is present
   - Create necessary directories and configuration files
   - Pull required container images

4. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   ./launch.sh
   ```

The script will automatically detect whether you have Docker or Podman installed and use the appropriate compose file.

## Usage

Once the container is running, you can access the web interface at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Configuration

The web UI container is configured with the following settings:

- Container name: `fusionloom-webui`
- Web interface port: `8080`
- Data persistence: All data is stored in the `data` directory

## Next Steps

Future versions of FusionLoom will expand on this foundation to include:
- Language Model Integration
- Generative AI Support (Stable Diffusion)
- Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text capabilities
- Container Management
- Performance Monitoring
- And more as outlined in the main README

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs in the `logs` directory
2. Ensure your container engine (Docker or Podman) is properly installed and running
3. Verify that port 8080 is not already in use
4. Try running the setup script again: `./setup.sh`
