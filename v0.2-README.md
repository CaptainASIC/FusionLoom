# FusionLoom v0.2

This is the second version (v0.2) of FusionLoom, building on the foundation of v0.1 with improved UI components, optimized code, and enhanced compatibility across different Linux distributions, particularly Arch Linux.

## Overview

FusionLoom v0.2 provides a refined web-based user interface using the open-webui container. This version features optimized JavaScript and CSS, real-time endpoint status checking, and improved container detection. It is designed to work seamlessly with both Docker and Podman container engines, with special attention to Arch Linux compatibility.

```

## Requirements

- Linux-based operating system (Debian, RHEL, Fedora, or Arch-based)
- Docker or Podman (will be installed by setup script if not present)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CaptainASIC/FusionLoom
   ```

2. Navigate to the FusionLoom directory:
   ```bash
   cd FusionLoom
   ```

3. Run the setup script:

   **For most Linux distributions:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   **For Arch Linux users:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x arch-setup.sh
   ./arch-setup.sh
   ```

   The setup script will:
   - Detect your OS and install necessary dependencies
   - Check for Docker or Podman and install Podman if neither is present
   - Create necessary directories and configuration files
   - Set up the custom UI files
   - Pull required container images

4. For Podman users on Arch Linux, configure socket permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x podman-socket-setup.sh
   ./podman-socket-setup.sh
   ```

5. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   ./launch.sh
   ```

The script will automatically detect whether you have Docker or Podman installed and use the appropriate compose file.

## Usage

Once the container is running, you can access the web interface at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

- Dark (default)
- Light
- Red
- Blue
- Green
- Purple
- System (follows system preference)

## Code Optimizations in v0.2

### Modular Code Architecture

For v0.2, we've restructured the codebase to follow modern best practices by breaking down the large monolithic files into smaller, more maintainable modules:

#### JavaScript Architecture

The JavaScript code has been reorganized into a modular structure:

```
ui/static/js/
├── main.js                 # Entry point that imports and initializes all modules
├── modules/
│   ├── ui.js               # UI initialization and navigation
│   ├── theme.js            # Theme management
│   ├── settings.js         # Settings management
│   ├── endpoints.js        # Endpoint status checking and management
│   ├── containers.js       # Container management
│   ├── performance.js      # Performance monitoring
│   ├── notifications.js    # Notification system
│   └── modals.js           # Modal dialogs
└── utils/
    ├── api.js              # API utilities
    ├── dom.js              # DOM manipulation helpers
    ├── storage.js          # Local storage utilities
    └── validation.js       # Form validation
```

Benefits of this approach:
- **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
- **Code Reusability**: Utilities and components can be reused across the application
- **Easier Testing**: Modules can be tested in isolation
- **Parallel Development**: Team members can work on different modules simultaneously

#### CSS Architecture

The CSS has been reorganized using a component-based approach:

```
ui/static/css/
├── main.css                # Entry point that imports all other CSS files
├── base/
│   ├── variables.css       # CSS variables for theming
│   ├── reset.css           # CSS reset/normalize
│   └── typography.css      # Typography styles
├── layout/
│   ├── grid.css            # Grid system
│   ├── sidebar.css         # Sidebar styles
│   └── content.css         # Main content area
├── components/
│   ├── buttons.css         # Button styles
│   ├── forms.css           # Form elements
│   ├── tables.css          # Table styles
│   ├── modals.css          # Modal dialogs
│   ├── notifications.css   # Notification styles
│   └── indicators.css      # Status indicators
├── themes/
│   ├── dark.css            # Dark theme
│   ├── light.css           # Light theme
│   └── [other themes].css  # Additional themes
└── utilities/
    ├── spacing.css         # Margin and padding utilities
    ├── display.css         # Display utilities
    └── responsive.css      # Responsive utilities
```

Benefits of this approach:
- **Improved Organization**: Styles are grouped by purpose
- **Reduced Specificity Issues**: Component isolation reduces CSS conflicts
- **Better Performance**: Only necessary CSS is loaded
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- **Consistent Styling**: Common components share styles

### Specific Optimizations

#### JavaScript Improvements

- **Real-time Endpoint Status Checking**: Replaced simulated endpoint status with actual HTTP requests
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better handling of JSON parsing errors and network failures
- **Async/Await Pattern**: Modernized code using async/await for better readability and error handling
- **Timeout Management**: Added proper timeout handling for API requests
- **Cross-Origin Support**: Added no-cors mode for checking external endpoints
- **Promise-based API**: Leveraged Promise.all for parallel endpoint checking
- **Event Delegation**: Improved event handling with delegation for better performance
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of non-critical components

#### CSS Improvements

- **Consistent Vertical Alignment**: Fixed alignment issues in tables and form elements
- **Standardized Button Sizing**: Consistent button dimensions for better UI
- **Improved Status Indicators**: Better positioning and visual feedback
- **Responsive Design Improvements**: Better mobile compatibility
- **Optimized Selectors**: More efficient CSS selectors for better performance
- **Variable-based Theming**: Enhanced theme system with CSS variables
- **Reduced Specificity**: Flatter CSS hierarchy for better maintainability
- **Logical Property Usage**: Using modern CSS logical properties for better RTL support

## Next Steps

Future versions of FusionLoom will expand on this foundation to include:
- Language Model Integration
- Generative AI Support (Stable Diffusion)
- Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text capabilities
- Container Management
- Performance Monitoring
- And more as outlined in the main README

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs in the `logs` directory
2. Ensure your container engine (Docker or Podman) is properly installed and running
3. Verify that port 8080 is not already in use
4. Try running the setup script again: `./setup.sh` (or `./arch-setup.sh` for Arch Linux)
5. If the custom UI is not loading, check that the volume mount in the compose file is correct
6. For settings persistence issues, try clearing your browser's localStorage

### Arch Linux Specific Issues

If you're using Arch Linux and encounter the "No matching distribution found for podman-py" error:
1. Use the `arch-setup.sh` script instead of the standard setup script
2. This script bypasses the graphical installer and sets up FusionLoom with default settings
3. The script automatically detects your architecture and configures the appropriate container settings
4. After setup completes, you can use `./launch.sh` as normal

### Container Detection Issues

If you see an error in the UI footer like "Error checking container status: Unexpected token '<'":
1. This is typically due to permission issues with the Podman or Docker socket

**For Podman users on Arch Linux:**
   - Use the provided script to configure Podman socket permissions (preferred method):
     ```bash
     chmod +x podman-socket-setup.sh
     ./podman-socket-setup.sh
     ```
     This script will:
     - Create systemd user service files for Podman
     - Enable and start the Podman socket
     - Configure the DOCKER_HOST environment variable
     - Update your .env file with the correct socket path
   
   - Alternatively, you can use the podman-docker package:
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S podman-docker
     ```

**For Docker users:**
   - Make sure your user is in the docker group:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
     # Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect
     ```

2. You can still use the application by manually adding containers through the UI
3. Click the "Add Container Manually" button in the footer to add containers like "fusionloom-ollama"
